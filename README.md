# ðŸ“° Headline Scraper

A simple Python script that scrapes top headlines from a news website (e.g., CNN) using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, and saves them to a `.txt` file.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Scrapes `<h2>` tags from a news site (like CNN)
- Extracts and cleans headline text
- Saves all headlines to a plain text file: `headlines.txt`

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.x recommended). Then install the following packages:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

â”œâ”€â”€ headlines.txt           # Output file with headlines
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # This file

 How It Works
Sends an HTTP GET request to a news website (e.g. CNN).
Parses the HTML response with BeautifulSoup.

Writes each headline to a new line in headlines.txt.
